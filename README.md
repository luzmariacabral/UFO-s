# UFO Sightings: An analysis 

Are we really alone in the universe?  In this challenge we were tasked with making a html page for journalist Dana, covering her enthusiasm for UFO sightings. She has a JavaScript file with some data of sightings and an article from an UFOlogist that she wants to include. The page is to be interactive with filters to be user friendly. A great beginning to what can become a large database of articles and recordings of UFO sightings.
